The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long (2.33 km) elevated linear park, greenway and rail trail created on a former New York Central Railroad spur on the west side of Manhattan in New York City. It was opened in June 2009 and funded mostly with public money. 

In this study we estimate the impact of opening the High Line Park in New York City on private property values in the surrounding areas. 
 
Using publically available data we built a model to study property values change in relation to their proximity to High Line. 

*Result - how to frame the new construction question?*
